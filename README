A simple HTML quotation mechanism for ocaml using camlp4.

Project based on the very good CUFP tutorial by Jake Donham and Nicolas Pouillard (http://cufp.org/conference/sessions/2010/camlp4-and-template-haskell).

Remark: for the ease of simplicity, closing tags in quotations are simply written </> (instead of </tag>).

As in HTML, <br> (or <BR) doesn't need to be closed.

== Hello World ==

<:html<
  <html> <body> <h1> Hello World! </> </> </>
>>

== Antiquotations ==

<:html< last modified : $flo:Unix.time ()$ >>

== Attributes ==

let tag1 = [ "class", "tag1" ]
let tag2 = <:html< class="tag2" >>
<:html< <div $alist:tag1$ $tag2$>foo</> >>
